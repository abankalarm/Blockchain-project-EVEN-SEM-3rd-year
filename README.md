## Setup

# init folder
truffle init

# compiling code
truffle compile

now we can look at .json compiled

# truffle config - to decide all

# migration file to allow migration
It helps to change the state of the database, basically any changes we made are pushed to ??active?? >

# now use ganache and deploy
truffle migrate

# truffle console
truffle console

> dealList = await DealList.deployed()
should return undefined

> dealList
should return bockchain

> dealList.address
should return default addresss used to deploy

> dealList.taskCount()
should return task number - right now 0
